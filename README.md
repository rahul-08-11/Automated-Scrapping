# Automated-Scrapping

## Overview
Automated-Scrapping is a program designed to automate the extraction of data about courses offered on the LinkedIn platform. It retrieves details such as course names, durations, instructors' names, and links to the courses.

## Program Capability
The program is built using the open-source automated testing framework Selenium. It requires users to input the course name, specifying the field in which they want to find courses (e.g., Data Analyst, Python, Machine Learning, etc.). Once the required input is provided, the program interacts with the browser to extract course details. After completing the extraction process, the program saves the extracted data in a DataFrame and exports it to an Excel file named '{your_input_field_name}.xlsx', making the data easily accessible and usable for users.

## Ideal Users
This program is ideal for businesses or individuals who need to track available courses on LinkedIn. It simplifies the process of gathering specific information related to users' fields of interest.
